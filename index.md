# About

Hi, I'm Evan. I am an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) master's student at UC Berkeley, advised by Professor [Jiantao Jiao](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jiantao/). I also completed my bachelor's degree in computer science at Berkeley.

My research focuses on Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for fine-tuning LLMs. Currently, much of my efforts revolve around reward model training and benchmarking.

I am also a Research Engineer at [Nexusflow](https://nexusflow.ai/), where I work on training LLMs like [Athene-70B](https://huggingface.co/Nexusflow/Athene-70B). I also work with [LMSYS](https://lmsys.org/), mainly on analyzing [Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/) and building LLM benchmarks.
